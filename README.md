# About
The SmartClean Dishwasher is an innovative home appliance developed through Model-Based Systems Engineering (MBSE) principles, offering an advanced and efficient dishwashing experience. This product showcases the successful integration of various engineering disciplines, from mechanical and electrical to software and control systems, to create a seamless user experience.

## Key Features:

* **Intelligent Cleaning Algorithms:** The dishwasher incorporates MBSE-driven algorithms that optimize the cleaning process based on load size, soil level, and water hardness. These algorithms ensure thorough cleaning while conserving water and energy.

* ** Modular Design**: Employing MBSE, the SmartClean Dishwasher was developed using a modular approach. This allows for easier maintenance and future upgrades. Each module is well-defined, promoting easy replacement and minimizing downtime.

* **User-Friendly Interface: **The intuitive touch-screen interface is a result of MBSE-driven user experience design. The interface provides a variety of wash cycle options, progress tracking, and maintenance alerts, enhancing user convenience.

* **Energy Efficiency:** MBSE principles were employed to optimize energy consumption by coordinating the dishwasher's components, such as water heaters and pumps, to work harmoniously. This results in shorter cycle times and reduced energy bills.

* **Water Management:** The dishwasher features a water recirculation system, developed using MBSE techniques, which filters and reuses water during cycles. This not only conserves water but also minimizes the load on sewage systems.

* **Remote Monitoring and Control:** Enabled through MBSE-driven IoT integration, users can monitor and control the dishwasher remotely using a smartphone app. This feature enhances flexibility and convenience in managing dishwashing tasks.

* **Reliability and Durability: **Applying MBSE-driven reliability engineering, the SmartClean Dishwasher was subjected to extensive simulations and testing. This ensures robust performance and longevity, reducing maintenance needs.

  
## Benefits:
